4. Jquery
	jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.

	The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.

	jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.

	jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.

5. Angular.js
	
S	Singel page applications

S	Two-way data binding - To put it simply, any changes in the user interface are accessible to the controller and,
	vice versa, any alteration of the controller or the model itself will be displayed in the user interface.
	
S	MVC - Thanks to various services and controllers employed in AngularJS, developers can divide an app into integral parts.

W	Two-way data binding appeared to be an imperfect solution. Overusing this feature resulted in the slow work of applications.

W	Given that the logic of a project is in its HTML markup, the development and maintenance are rather problematic.

W	AngularJS works directly with DOM and not with Virtual DOM. Which we see later is a better approach.

W	It's kind of big! Like really big!

W	scale poorly - bigger it gets, the harder it is to maintain. Rewrite etc.
